Unlike ECDSA (which Ethereum and Bitcoin are based on) it\u2019s much slower, and creating private keys is more involved.\n\nTo upgrade e.g. Ethereum to use e.g the Falcon algorithm, you\u2019ll need to do one of 2 things: update the base cryptography of the blockchain, essentially creating a new blockchain everyone needs to migrate to (and I do mean every wallet, smart contract, pool, token etc.), or adopt Abstracted Accounts that use Falcon to secure your funds, and then use the existing ECDSA to transfer them.\n\nBoth ideas have been floated and researched. Idea 1 is too big - essentially means relaunching Ethereum- and it would be slower and clunkier (until better implementations of Falcon are produced). Idea 2 is what Vitalik has been pushing for 2 years now. Account Abstraction (AA) makes a lot of sense, requires no major infrastructure changes, and has plenty of other benefits (check out ERC-4337). But because of gas concerns, and slow public uptake, only a few protocols and dApps picked it up. My guess is the adoption rate of AAs will start growing in coming years.\n\nIf you were to build a new blockchain today, you could (should) make its core cryptography QR. It may be slower (for now) but safer.\n\nFinal thought: everyone in the crypto world is terrified of quantum computers stealing their funds. But if a quantum machine appears one day, able to crack cryptographic algorithms, it will be used on better targets than cryptocurrencies. Banks, companies, money transfer systems - have way more value than all of crypto combined. Heck, the first thing to go will be SSL - no more web security, no more encrypted internet (there is a QR version of SSL, and it even exists in Chrome, but every web server in the world will need to adopt it, and it is, at the risk of repeating myself, quite slow)."

Despite the consistent gains in value, it\u2019s still a crap shoot and based primarily on more people wanting to it. So if you jumped on at the current top value of right about $100,000K, your investment was a loss, that could change for the better, but when and in which direction is still just a guess.

It's really easy to track foreign exports, and you can sanction countries receiving goods from Russia regardless of how they pay, so it isn't about circumventing trade sanctions on any scale.\n\nMost likely, this is a small group of Russian cronies that are suffering at the hands of international sanctions, limiting their lifestyle in Monaco. BTC may be a way for them to get around personal sanctions, or move their wealth somewhere safe from the Russian economic collapse; as long as Russia allows them to. Like everything in Russia, the motivation will be to keep the oligarchy wealthy, not to somehow benefit the wider country or economy."

The US is the most powerful entity in the world, but its not because of the military. Its because the US controls the *worlds* reserve currency, the dollar. That is the true source of US hegemony. The centralized currency the US controls that functions as the default means of exchange and wealth storage in the world. \n\nTherefor, it logically follows that BTC threatens this control. It has too. That threat is outlined in BTC's white paper. Of course the government would be standoffish with another form of currency. Just looking at FIAT, the US has spent decades strategically suppressing the value of other currencies. And in some cases, out right destroyed them. \n\nOf course it is the US governments kneejerk reaction to do this to crypto, destroy it.\n\nThat said, I am of the opinion that of all other currencies, crypto probably has the most realistic shot at debasing USD as the worlds reserve currency. And, the US government lacks most of the traditional strategic tools they have used in the past to suppress other currencies. \n\nWhat the US *should do* is develop a strategic reserve of BTC. Essentially, hedging their bet that the dollar will, or will not, remain the worlds reserve currency. If the dollar fails, great, you've loaded up on BTC and when that shift away from the dollar happens, you can leave other nations holding the bag. If the dollar does not fail, well that is fine too, you still control the reserve currency, but your bet is still hedged, and at this point, BTC is becoming to big to fail."

I had all my LTC (about 2000) on what was once one of the largest exchanges - BTC-E. In 2017, for no reason what-so-ever, they suspended my account. There was news at the time that many accounts were being suspended with no recourse. I actively tried for 5 months to get access to my account, but to no avail. Then, the owner of BTC-E disappeared, and soon after, the FBI raided the operation and took everything.\n\nNeedless to say, I never got my 2000 LTC back. This story also explains the origin of my username.\n\nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/btc-e-operator-pleads-guilty-money-laundering-conspiracy\n\nAny way - my point is: welcome to crypto!"

It just takes a lot more $s to move the mega market caps (bitcoin, ethereum, hell i haven't seen USDT move nearly at all).\n\nSo take your 20x profits from small caps that become mid caps, and roll some or most of it back into your reserve/standard position - for me a mix of BTC, ETh and maybe a couple others.  They will also go down less in bear market."

I have zero interest in any other coin, because I am happy with my Bitcoin returns and I can't be bothered to pick anything new. Bitcoin is perfect. I don't even need to invest in Bitcoin anymore. My last purchase was in Nov 2022 when FTX imploded. Prices were too tempting to stay away. That said, what I have invested has grown more than what I expected, and it will grow even further from here on out.

Why bother with something so rare it's 100% in the hands of a few, and deep down it's just a bunch of hashes and keys with no value or alternate use?"

This cohort reached its peak Bitcoin supply in September and has since distributed 507,000 BTC, a smaller amount compared to the 934,000 BTC sold during the March 2024 rally. Despite this, long-term holders are achieving record profits, realizing $2.02 billion in profit per day. This activity plays a crucial role in price discovery, as these holders release previously dormant supply into circulation.

It\u2019s because there\u2019s constant buy pressure from ETF\u2019s and other institutional vehicles (like MSTR).\n\nImagine a small ecosystem of 10 investors. 5 are retail. 5 are institutional.\n\nThe 5 institutional buyers keep buying no matter what. Their investment horizon is 5+ years. They just keep buying.\n\nThe 5 retail buyers fluctuate. Sometimes they buy and sometimes they sell. But the moment they sell it all, they don\u2019t have more sell. \n\nSo now the 5 institutional investors end up pushing prices higher because they never stop buying and the scarcity goes up.\n\nThis is why when these retailers sell, they always complain prices go up. It\u2019s because once you sell, you no longer participate in the buy and sell cycle. There\u2019s only institutional buyers left and they keep pushing prices up.\n\nThe way to win in BTC is to think very long term. This is why MSTR\u2019s bond maturation is 5 years.

So I was right with my skepticism (read below) as price predictions are totally unlike what Hosk talks abouts. However, the things he actually said there are way more exciting. He talks about implementing Minotaur with BITCOIN! OMG I've expected they iwll make their own PoW or merge with Ergo or something. But comboining Cardano's PoS security with BITCOIN's PoW security? That's soooo exciting, beyond my expectations. He also talked about implementing Bitcoin into CArdano's Lace wallet, where you could naturally and easily bridge the ecosystems, and allow DeFi on bitcoin! He also said the awesome overcryptocollaterialzed stablecoin DJED will also get Bitcoin collateral. That's also amazing!\n\nNow my initial reaction after I just read the headline, before watching his speech:\n\nSeriously? Common man, I love Cardano, and when Charles makes these educational technical blackboard vides, and sometimes some funny AMAs. On the other hands I'm not too much into his right-wing political rants, but predicting moons feels quite unlike him, did he really say that? I'mn gonna watch that speech to fact check what's it about, and in 10 minutes I'll edit what I actually head there. Becaume right now I've always seen him not caring about price predictions, he always says price goes up down and it has no effect on the actual tech, he of course celebrates when the price hits some nice high, but moon prediction? Well, I'm listening right now to see for myself if he really seriouly gonna say that there. Right now I kinda expect him to just jokingly say hey it might go to 250K or 500K or down, we dont know. I've never seen him seriously make price predictions and I listen to him a lot, so I'll see, listening right now, 14 minutes left."

This forecast is driven by increasing institutional investment and the potential growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) on Bitcoin, which could enhance its utility.

The crypto market has reacted positively to this prediction, with Bitcoin experiencing significant price fluctuations, and analysts remain cautiously optimistic about its long-term prospects.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

The gaming industry has adapted it. Every major US bank has partnered with it. Avalanche is launching a new version soon. That will reduce fee by 99% and it will make launching L1 s 99% cheaper.

XRP's whole use case hinges on pro crypto regulations and governments. Like before we can even consider the possibility that banks or other institutions would ever use it, the US government has to become pro crypto. Trump winning along with at least 250 pro crypto lawmakers signals a massive reversal that's about to happen with the US governments approach on crypto.\n\nThis isn't about fucking Brad Garlinghouse getting a spot in the Trump administration, which on its face sounds like a stupid rumor, it's about the people that Trump puts in the SEC to settle the Ripple case and approve XRP ETFs, and it's about a pro crypto congress finally passing a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. Will XRP ever be adopted by financial institutions? Who knows? Is a pro crypto regulatory regime a step towards that happening? Absolutely. That's why we're seeing this pump right now and why it's almost certain to continue well into 2025."

            "text": "The amount of negative assumptions made by OP suggests he is very but hurt he didn\u2019t buy XRP.\n\n1 - not giant wave of red alone. There are real world utilities to XRP and other tech based chains. Realised or not, it\u2019s true; more than BTC store of value coin. Adoption TBC granted. \n\n2 - all perceptions of value are dangerous thinking... It\u2019s just a risk/reward gambit. Is there risk with XRP like you stated? Of course; the whole Ripple corporation could go the way of FTX and be found corrupt and tank it. But that\u2019s what educated assessments are and a willingness to wait risk reward. That\u2019s like being a religious believer in BTC, MSTR or AI companies for that matter - all of these are trading at a premium based on future value propositions. \n\n3 - please mention the others that have a large institutional backing and proven tech system? Stellar has already deployed into both retail and institutional sectors and proven to work over years. Fonbnk in Africa, Felix in Latin America, remittances in Ukraine (who are rolling stellar into their banking systems). Does this imply skyrocketing prices? Maybe / maybe not, but see (2). I implore you to please provide these other examples you touch on but then didn\u2019t supply. \n\n4 - poster proves his position; he is actually butt hurt he didn\u2019t buy XRP. \u201cDon\u2019t want to Crash the market?\u201d - what a white knight in shinning armour. Where were you in 2008 and 2020\nFor the equities market. Literally everything humans perceive in value is a mementic, except for companies that own IP or have rights to scare resources. You sound like Schiff; just chill out.\n\nTL;DR - actually not sure given by your post history why you are worried - you hold BTC and it\u2019s a SoV coin that\u2019s been accepted by the market. The only people that I would expect to this level of fear about XRP are SOL holders and ETH soon enough."

The tokenomics and fundamentals are way too sketch for me. But let's not get down on people making profits. I have friends who are long-time bag holders and I'm happy for them.

I'm talking about rebalancing and risk tolerance. If, based on your own evaluation, you feel like your portfolio can withstand being 20% invested in XRP, and then the value of your XRP goes from $2,000 to say, $6000, then your portfolio is now worth $14,000, and now the XRP is\u00a0***42%***\u00a0of your total value. If your prior risk profile says that you're really only comfortable with 20% exposure, then you need to be honest with yourself, and move \\~$3k of the XRP into your other holdings. Doing just about anything else is essentially trying to time the market, and I would bet that 99.99% of people are incapable of doing that. And not because they are not smart or intellectually capable - but purely because they don't have the time and insider knowledge to be confident and\u00a0*correct*\u00a0about their positions. The only viable options for them are hold on for dear life, or an objective risk based approach, and the risk based approach will win almost every time (especially if we're talking about fringe coins like XRP).\n\nAnd FWIW my number is 5%. So I spent the last 5 years slowly purchasing XRP (mostly though there were some spikes that triggered sells), as its value dropped relative to other assets, and my % got off. So now I'm slowly selling in the exact same way."

Although this had a lot of profit taking on the 04/13/2024 (25 days) so of these two tops is 36.5 days.\n\nLooking to this bull run of 2024... It started for XRP roughly on 12/11/2024 and has been running for 30 days so far. So I'd probably give XRP another 7 or 8 days, taking us to 17th or 18th December 2024; at this bull run before it starts pulling back. \n\nSo if you're thinking of profit taking; look to do this on 17th or 18th December could be a good idea?"

            "text": "tldr; XRP has become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after a significant rally of nearly 300% in November. Its market cap reached approximately $110 billion, surpassing BNB's $94.422 billion. XRP's price surged from $0.491 to $1.957 within the month. This growth follows a favorable court ruling in July 2023, where a judge determined that Ripple's sales of XRP were not securities, dismissing SEC allegations against Ripple executives. XRP is now close to overtaking Solana, the fourth-largest crypto asset.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR."

This marks a 274% increase over the past month. The surge is attributed to the potential for a more crypto-friendly U.S. administration under Donald Trump, which could ease regulatory pressures from the SEC, particularly concerning Ripple Labs. The anticipation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler's resignation in January 2025 is also contributing to the optimism surrounding XRP's future regulatory environment.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

There was news at the time that many accounts were being suspended with no recourse. I actively tried for 5 months to get access to my account, but to no avail. Then, the owner of BTC-E disappeared, and soon after, the FBI raided the operation and took everything.\n\nNeedless to say, I never got my 2000 LTC back.

Those 840k might be bigger if every single asset transaction would be counted. See my Eaxample below.  \n  \nBecause in cardanos eutxo model in one transaction you have much more assets than inside of one account based model transaction (like eth or solana) the numpber of 840k (in real its much higher) is not compareable to account based models.\n\nExample: I Claim my lp rewards on VY Finance or Minswap. On Both apps I got about 10 different pools.  \nIts from my side 2 transactions. But I moved rewards from 20 different coins and tokens.\n\nThan I also send those 20 different token to another wallet.\n\nConclusion. I needed just 5 transactions (3 times mine, 2 times automatic claiming system for 20 assets). But compared to an account based model It was 60 transactions.\n\nBAAAAAM\n\nThats the reason I am in Cardano SINCE 2017!"

The rise in transactions and network usage suggests growing interest and adoption within the Cardano ecosystem.

To Core extension, which can then be connected to dApps (if you want to use the Ledger to connect to them)\n\n2. To our dApp. Core web (https://core.app) directly to be used only as a wallet (can't connect to other dApps)\n\nAre the funds that you currently have assocaited with the Ledger, or do you have a separate Core wallet already? We used to have an old wallet that was deprecated in March, the Avalanche Wallet (wallet.avax.network). You would want to access that previous wallet in Core first to then move the funds to the Ledger, if the funds are still on the P-Chain.\n\nIf you are still having trouble with this issue - my team can assist further. There is a live chat option on the Avalanche knowledge base (https://wallet.avax.network), ask in our Discord server (https://chat.avax.network), or you can email us at support@avax.network directly."

Regardles, whatever issues you're having with them you would have to work out with the exchange.  \n\nThe only thing I could think of is was the AVAX you sent on the AVAX network?  A lot of coins in Trust Wallet are on the BSC network which is the Binance network.  You can only send coins on that network to Binance exchange and private wallets that support the Binance network.  \n\nDouble check your transaction history in your Trust wallet and verify the coins were sent on the AVAX network.  \n\nAll crypto must be sent and received on the same network or it will be lost."

Avalanche\u2019s subnets allow for seamless interoperability between different blockchains and scalability. This allows other platforms to use avalanche as its infrastructure without congestion. That\u2019s what we mean by \u201clayer 0.\u201d \nAvalanche9000 is launching in a week and will decrease costs by 99%. Avalanche CEO is confirmed as of 2 days ago to be working with the Trump administration. California has turned to AVAX to support their state DMV  which supports 42 million people. The AVAX coin is deflationary and the memes on avalanche have insane potential. \n\nAvalanche will still be going up in price 10 years from now, even though it will have dips along the way. It is a legitimate, serious project that solves an important problem with no competition and United States presidential support and it doesn\u2019t even have mass acknowledgement yet. Avax is super early.  I love it."
