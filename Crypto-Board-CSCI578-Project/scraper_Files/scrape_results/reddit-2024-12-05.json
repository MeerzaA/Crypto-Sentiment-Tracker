The drive's location has been narrowed to a small area, but the local council has repeatedly denied him permission to search, citing legal and environmental concerns. Howells has offered to donate 10% of the Bitcoin's value to the community if successful and is suing the city for the right to search or for $629 million in compensation.

            "text": "I've been saying this for months, but\u2026 this time it really is different.\n\nThe launch of the ETF has changed the game in ways we\u2019re only beginning to see, and if I\u2019m right, we won\u2019t fully understand the impact until the cycle plays out.\n\nMy gut feeling is that ETFs are adding stability to BTC. The days of massive 30\u201350% corrections might be behind us, especially as more and more people funnel into BTC via their retirement accounts. (Key word there: \"Retirement accounts\")\n\nThink about it: large swaths of the population are now holding BTC in their 401(k)s, which they can't touch until they're 55 or 59 \u00bd. So let\u2019s say you\u2019ve got a Gen X or Millennial in their early-to-mid 40s, with 10-15 years to go until retirement. They see the potential\u2014estimates of BTC hitting $1 million, or even $13 million, in the next 5\u201315 years\u2014and it starts to look like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with relatively low risk. They could drop $100k into BTC, and maybe make $1 million or more, without putting their 401k at risk. Especially since many are already 401(k) millionaires at this point.\n\nNow, take that thinking and apply it across the population. You\u2019ve got huge daily inflows of cash into BTC via ETFs, and those ETFs are gobbling up more BTC than miners can even produce\u2014something like 10x the amount being mined. The rest of that BTC is coming from the open market, and guess what? Those hardcore BTC maxis who said \u201ci\u2019Ll neVEr sEll\u201d are selling. But they\u2019re selling to BlackRock, Grayscale, MicroStrategy\u2026 big players who are now stacking more and more BTC.\n\nEventually, we\u2019re going to hit a point where there\u2019s just not enough BTC available on the open market to make a meaningful impact on the price\u2014except to push it higher. We\u2019re essentially seeing a lock-up of BTC in retirement accounts through ETFs. Sure, you can sell it, but why would you? Most people with 401(k)s don\u2019t pay attention to their accounts on a daily basis. They\u2019re just long-term holders by default. Plus, with trading restricted to market hours, and not being able to trade on weekends, this only further cements the \"HODL\" mentality for most of these accounts.\n\nSo yeah, when I say this time is different, I really do believe it. I think we\u2019ll still see corrections, but I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll see the huge dips we\u2019ve seen in the past\u2014at least not to the same degree.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s just my take. Maybe it\u2019s fan fiction, who knows? But I\u2019m sticking to it."

Pi cycle indicator. Alt performance, we could keep going but none of these are even flashing a yellow light let alone red. So in 2015 and 2016 there was a $1,000 Target on Bitcoin. Everyone was excited for that and we blew right past it and it just kept going all the way up to 20K over the next year. In 2021 people started to fixate on 100k. Came up short. Lot of headwinds. This time people are fixated on 100k and we're there before the cycle even gets going. I don't really know what the future is going to bring any more than any of you but a lot of things are certainly looking like this one is going to outperform somewhere north of 100k. This is the most incredible narrative I've ever seen for crypto. It's encouraging the gamblers, it's encouraging leverage, it's encouraging rampant speculation and that can go on for months."

Totally possible but all within the time frame of now until q4 of 2025? Ehh. Idk man. That's a stretch.\n\nEither way, with lower interest rates and a pro crypto admin, it'll be a good run, regardless. The bigger concern that I have is the price that it'll be when it drops on the bear. Unfortunately, I got a little too risky on the last run, so this bullrun I need to de-risk myself by actually taking profits and moving it into btc. It'll just suck for me if it shoots up to 500-1 million and only retrace to 300 million or so. \n\nHoping for a good run, just not a ballistic run where the price never goes down to at least 100k or less. 300k is still a good price to buy though."

It's because no other algorithm created since can do it better.\n\nLet me put it this way...\n\nImagine that for a long time everyone used square wheels. They were clunky and difficult to use but it was all we had. So we dug divots in the road that the corners of the square wheels could fit into as they passed over it. We created incredible suspension systems to try to compensate for the poor design. Solution after solution was built around the square wheel. The whole world making back breaking adjustments to accommodate for this terrible invention, the square wheel. \n\nSatoshi gave us the concept of a round wheel.\n\nNow we have to undo all of the accommodations we've made for the square wheel.\n\nThere are a lot of opportunists out there who claimed to have invented an even rounder wheel, but that sounds really stupid, right? \n\nIf you dig deep into the inner workings of altcoins, you run into one of three things typically: \n\n1) a \"trust me bro\" black box of closed source code \n\n2) a traditional finance tool shoehorned into blockchain \n\n3) a Ponzi scheme\n\nWe've been using a flawed financial infrastructure for so long that people in general can't even comprehend what a healthy financial infrastructure looks like. So they think that if they can get a loan from blockchain, it's got to be more secure, right? \n\nThis is Idiocracy. \n\nThe whole point is, we have proven time and time again that loaning money to each other that doesn't exist is not sustainable. No matter how you package it. No matter how hyped your community is. No matter how many promises you make. No matter what your vision is. No matter who your partners are.\n\nSo, will \"utility\" tokens outshine bitcoin? Yes. Absolutely. As soon as they make a rounder wheel. Godspeed."

For all the people who say, \u201cwhy would you buy shares of MSTR when you can straight up buy Bitcoin,\u201d there are several reasons.. \n\nCertain financial instruments like 401k\u2019s, IRAs, Retirement / Pension funds don\u2019t make it easy for you to buy Bitcoin directly. If you opt for Bitcoin ETFs you pay management fees which compound into your gain potential. \n\nMicroStrategy offers a unique way to amplify exposure to Bitcoin. While Bitcoin itself is the ultimate scarce asset, MSTR leverages strategies like issuing stock or convertible bonds at ultra-low interest rates (0.6-0.8%) to buy more BTC. This allows the company to effectively leverage Bitcoin\u2019s growth potential without traditional operating expenses diluting shareholder value.\n\nUnlike other companies that dilute shares for inventory, R&D, or other costs, Microstrategy directly converts raised capital into Bitcoin, increasing its BTC holdings and enhancing its balance sheet. This creates a leveraged play on Bitcoin, offering 2-3x returns compared to Bitcoin\u2019s direct performance, given the compounding effect of debt-financed BTC acquisition.\n\nAlso, Microstrategy\u2019s ability to \u201cprint\u201d shares strategically amplifies Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity while benefiting shareholders. If MicroStrategy begins distributing dividends in BTC in the future, it would further strengthen its appeal as a stock-backed Bitcoin proxy. There\u2019s also many other products in the works as well. \n\nBasically, MSTR is ideal for those looking for a leveraged way to benefit from Bitcoin\u2019s upside, with Saylor\u2019s vision and strategy aligning to maximize BTC exposure. You get leveraged benefits of BTC, all while the buisness intelligence, mobile software and cloud-based services side of the company is still profitable as well.\n\nThat being said, Saylor is going to have a 1/1 fiat moat and monopoly with the largest pool of digital capital in the USA, most likely the world. \n\n$1T + market cap with products for every investor. \n\nThere is value being in the system."

Not only are your assets plummeting in value, you now have to sell that asset to pay off debts, etc which further compounds the issue.\n\nAlso, this feels like it goes against the whole reason crypto exists. Instead of having this as a useful currency being used in the market, you just have someone holding onto it for pure speculation. Do they have plans to expand the usability of BTC somehow? Or make it easier for people to buy and use BTC? MSTR just makes BTC feel even more like tulip bulb mania. I feel like if a bear market happens, BTC is going to enter a death spiral because of MSTR and people will be even more skeptical of crypto going forward. Just FTX with a different spin."

This surge is attributed to $2.2 billion in investments last week, driven by looser monetary policy and the Republican party's recent electoral success. The majority of investments are in U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, approved by the SEC, allowing both sophisticated and retail investors to invest in cryptocurrencies. Ethereum also saw significant investment, with $646 million flowing into related products.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Exchanges love this because they make a ton of money with people buying and selling in fees. Eth holders love it because those who transfer Shib to cold wallet pay eth for fees which burns eth supply. A Shib whale as an individual is not someone that took actual 21 million dollars and bought Shib. They took eth that they have had and bought at $1 or mined in early days and exchanged it for Shib. They don\u2019t really care about Shib. They are buying Shib to burn eth supply to made their eth more valuable and go up. These gentlemen and ladies have millions and some even have billions in Eth value to exchange. Every time eth is exchanged on eth blockchain eth percentage is burned this includes any crypto that uses eth block chain like Shib, lessen the supply of Eth making it go up in value. Eth is stalled and not going up as fast as Bitcoin is. If Shib goes up then that is extra for them, For Shib, we need to burn a lot of the supply by using their block chain on their exchange. Anyone here doing that? Anyone here staking their Shib there? Also The problem is the people Shib Devs that control how much is burned; it is not automatic like eth block chain. Someone there has to push the key to burn Shib by sending it to the dead wallet.  Any volunteers that wanna burn their Shib? Anyway it will be a very long time before burns through two zeros. Maybe 2026 one zero or close to it like .00009 for a few months. I see Shib as that hot girl friend or boy friend that is big tease. All tokens that are on exchanges will do well this coming year. My advice is look at the chart history for Shib to know best time to buy. Right now and coming weeks are going to be interesting. I wish you all great success for 2025."

At .0005 would be worth $500. At .005 would be worth $5,000.  $100 worth would be $2,000 and $20,000. The way I see it; it's a low risk investment with almost unlimited upside potential. Even if it tanks the losses would be minimal."

            "text": "If it\u2019s been 24 hours and your SHIB hasn\u2019t shown up in Kraken yet, it\u2019s worth checking a few things:\n\n\n\nTransaction Status: Check the transaction ID (TxID or hash) in your Binance withdrawal history. This should give you a link to view the status on the blockchain explorer. If the status shows as \"Complete\" or \"Confirmed,\" it means the funds have left Binance. However, if it\u2019s still \"Pending,\" the transaction hasn\u2019t fully processed on Binance\u2019s side yet.\n\nNetwork Used: Make sure that the network you chose on Binance (like Ethereum/ERC-20, BSC, etc.) is one that Kraken supports for SHIB deposits. Kraken may only support specific networks, and if you used an unsupported one, the funds may not arrive automatically in your account. You may need to contact Kraken support in that case.\n\nDeposit Address: Double-check that the address you pasted from Kraken into Binance matches your Kraken SHIB deposit address exactly. Any difference would mean the funds went elsewhere, although this is rare if you copied/pasted directly.\n\nWait for Confirmations: Sometimes, deposits can be delayed due to network congestion or maintenance on Kraken\u2019s end. It may just be a matter of waiting for more confirmations.\n\nIf everything looks correct and the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, you may need to reach out to Kraken support for further assistance. They might be able to help track down the deposit.\n\n\n\n\n(Got this answer from chatgpt btw. It helped me with a recent crypto issue myself)"

            "text": "Realistically, maybe drop another couple of zeros, $0.001 tops. If SHIB had the market cap of BTC today, the price would be $0.002997. That's about 113X from where it is right now. So, as crypto adoption increases, and if they burn enough SHIB, yeah, maybe it could get to  $0.0005, by 2030 or longer, but I'm not sure how likely that is. If you 10X from here in the next few years, I'd consider that a big win, if you want to hold onto it until retirement age (if it even survives it that long) then maybe you'll 50X to around $0.0012. Kind of the way google and apple stockholders who bought in 2001 still have their shares.\n\nIf you thought you'd strike it big from buying $500 of SHIB anytime after it was listed on major CEX's, it ain't gonna happen. You needed to buy within a month of launch to make moves like that, back when it had 10 zeros after the decimal. But turning $500 into $30K over 25 years, sure, it's possible. It's the 11th most popular coin in the world right now, so it has a decent chance of surviving. For SHIB, it's going to be about holding long term."
